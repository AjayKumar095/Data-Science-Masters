    "  In software development, the concept of <strong>information hiding</strong> is an integral aspect of encapsulation. Information hiding involves the deliberate concealment of implementation details within a class, exposing only a well-defined public interface to external code.

Private attributes or methods can only be accessed or modified through controlled interfaces, reducing the risk of data misuse or corruption.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <li><strong>Reduced Complexity:</strong> By hiding the internal workings of a class, information hiding reduces the complexity of external code. Developers interact with the public interface, focusing on the essential functionalities without being burdened by intricate implementation details.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <li><strong>Improved Maintainability:</strong> Concealing implementation details allows for better maintainability. Changes to the internal structure of a class, such as modifying attributes or methods, do not impact external code as long as the public interface remains unchanged. This isolation simplifies updates and enhancements.</li>\n",
    "\n",

Developers can evolve the internal implementation of a class without affecting the overall functionality.
